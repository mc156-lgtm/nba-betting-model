## 📝 Notes

### Data Quality
- Current synthetic data is for demonstration only
- Real NBA data will have missing values, inconsistencies
- Need robust data cleaning pipeline

### Model Performance
- Synthetic data results are not representative
- Real-world accuracy will be lower
- Market efficiency makes consistent edge difficult

### Betting Strategy
- Model is one input to betting decisions
- Should combine with other analysis
- Proper bankroll management is critical
- Track all bets for continuous improvement
